# Shoppable Video

Shoppable Video, a web application is a solution which will let the user take a snapshot of scene in the movie/tv show, mark items/celebrities of interest and analyse the snapshotted frame. Then the solution would display the identified celebrities with details and the list of products available for purchasing on e-commerce sites for identified items. The solution would also recommend movie titles to the user considering userâ€™s interaction with celebrities. The snapshots taken by the user would get added in snapshots library which is a searchable list.

# Tech

Shoppable Video uses a number of cloud resources and open source projects to work properly:

- [AWS Services](https://aws.amazon.com/)
- [ReactJS](https://reactjs.org/)
- [VideoJS](https://videojs.com/)
- [MarkerJS](https://videojs.com/)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)

# Architecture Overview

The diagram below presents the architecture of Shoppable Video and illustrates the different AWS resources used.

![Architecture](./public/images/Architecture.drawio.png)

## Workflow

1. The snapshotted frame and selected area of the snapshotted frame for making a lookup request in the application is saved in this [Amazon S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/) bucket, which will be later used by [Amazon Rekognition](https://aws.amazon.com/rekognition/) for identifying different objects and also by the application for rendering the snapshot in UI.

1. The [AWS Cognito](https://aws.amazon.com/cognito/) is used for providing sign-up and sign-in options for the application users and [AWS Amplify](https://aws.amazon.com/amplify/) for building the web application.

1. The [Amazon API Gateway](https://aws.amazon.com/api-gateway/) is used to set up API endpoints for serving the client requests with the help of [AWS Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/) functions.

1. [AWS Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/) stores all the snapshot details in DynamoDB for the users.

1. [AWS Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/) function tells Amazon Rekognition for identifying different objects present in the image stored in [Amazon S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/) bucket.

1. The metadata for the Dataset group of AWS Personalize is stored in this [Amazon S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/) Bucket which is imported to [AWS Personalize](https://aws.amazon.com/personalize/) for creating solution.

1. [AWS Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/) function gets the recommendations from AWS Personalize for the users and another [AWS Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/) function ingests real-time events using event trackers.

1. [AWS Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/) further makes request to PA-API and populates the details of identified objects for the users which is being simulated for few objects with static data for now.

# Source Code

1. Download the automated CloudFormation templates **"shoppable-video.yml"** and **"cloudfront-shoppable-video.yml"** found in **cloudformation-templates**.
2. Push the **"user-engagement-and-monetisation-for-streaming-media-content"** repository to [AWS CodeCommit](https://aws.amazon.com/codecommit/). You can follow links given below for your reference.
